Design and Development of an Expense Management and Budgeting Application 

This thesis presents the development of an expense and budget management application 
BudgetPlanner which is designed to improve the financial management process by providing 
an easy-to-use, user-centered mobile application.  
The application allows users to set savings goals and track their progress in order to achieve 
them. In addition, categorizing spending allows users to control their expenses and have a 
clear picture of how their money is being spent. By incorporating features such as setting 
savings goals and providing visual representation with progress bars, the app encourages 
better financial habits and promotes goal achievement. 
A human-centered design approach was adopted to ensure that the app's interface is simple, 
visually appealing and easy to navigate. To gather some baseline data on user preferences 
and functionality, a survey was distributed via Google Forms. This addition was particularly 
helpful in making important design and functionality decisions, while emphasizing simplic
ity and ease of use. 
The paper also covers the technical aspects of the development, including the choice of the 
cross-platform framework React Native and tools such as Expo, Node.js and MongoDB, which 
were used to improve the functionality and performance of the application. In addition, the 
use of Python for transaction simulation helped testing the application. 
The result is a user-friendly method of tracking daily spending and creating financial goals, 
with the focus of the work being to provide insightful information as to how to create finan
cial applications on mobile phones.
